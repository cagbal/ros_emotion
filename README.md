A ROS Package for Recognizing the Emotions by using EmoPy Package

Unfortuntaly, the code is not running fine with current version of EmoPy Package, so please contact me for more info, if you are interested.  

The code base is created during the Hamburg Secondment of ESR 5 in the scope of SOCRATES project.

This repo is in active development; therefore, there are many errors and bad things can happen.
